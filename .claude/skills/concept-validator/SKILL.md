# Game Concept Validator Skill

This skill **stress-tests game concepts** by analyzing technical feasibility, identifying scope risks, and providing realistic assessments based on similar games and industry patterns.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Invoke this skill when the user:
- Says "validate this game concept"
- Asks "is this game idea feasible?"
- Presents a game concept and wants reality-check
- Says "can I build [game description]?"
- Asks "what are the risks of this idea?"
- Wants to know "how long would this take?"
- Needs to convince stakeholders (team, investors, etc.)

---

## Core Principle

**Honest, constructive validation** that:
- ✅ Identifies technical challenges early
- ✅ Provides realistic scope estimates
- ✅ Compares to proven similar games
- ✅ Highlights both strengths and risks
- ✅ Suggests scope adjustments if needed
- ✅ Empowers informed decision-making

**This is NOT a "yes/no" tool** - it's a reality check that helps users build smarter.

---

## Input Requirements

The skill needs the user to provide:

### Required Information
1. **Game Concept Description**
   - Core gameplay loop
   - Primary mechanics
   - Genre/style
   - Target experience

### Contextual Information (Ask if missing)
2. **Development Context**
   - Timeline (days/weeks/months)
   - Team size and roles
   - Engine/tools being used
   - Experience level

3. **Scope Parameters**
   - Target platform
   - Expected playtime/content
   - Production quality expectations
   - Must-have vs nice-to-have features

---

## Validation Workflow

### Phase 1: Concept Analysis

**Extract and categorize:**

1. **Core Mechanics**
   - What are the primary gameplay mechanics?
   - How many systems need to interact?
   - What's the complexity of each system?

2. **Technical Requirements**
   - Physics/movement systems needed?
   - AI/pathfinding complexity?
   - Networking/multiplayer?
   - Procedural generation?
   - Save/load systems?
   - UI complexity?

3. **Content Requirements**
   - Art assets needed (count and complexity)
   - Audio requirements
   - Level/map design scope
   - Narrative/dialogue volume
   - Animation complexity

4. **Scope Indicators**
   - Number of interconnected systems
   - Content volume (levels, enemies, items)
   - Polish expectations
   - Platform requirements

---

### Phase 2: Feasibility Assessment

**Evaluate each aspect:**

#### Technical Feasibility
- **🟢 Low Risk**: Built-in engine features, proven patterns
- **🟡 Medium Risk**: Custom systems, moderate complexity
- **🔴 High Risk**: Novel tech, complex integration, multiplayer

#### Scope Feasibility
- **Timeline vs Features**: Can stated features fit timeline?
- **Team vs Workload**: Enough people for required disciplines?
- **Experience vs Complexity**: Does team have needed expertise?

#### Common Risk Patterns

**🚨 Red Flags:**
- "Open world" without large team/timeline
- Multiplayer for first-time developers
- "Procedural everything" without PCG experience
- 3D + physics + AI + multiplayer simultaneously
- "Like GTA but..." scope creep
- Vague core loop ("explore and discover")

**⚠️ Yellow Flags:**
- Many systems with unclear integration
- Ambitious AI without prototyping
- Complex UI/UX without designer
- Cross-platform without testing resources
- Content-heavy with small team

**✅ Green Flags:**
- Clear, focused core loop
- Proven mechanics in new combination
- Incremental feature set (MVP → polish)
- Technical scope matches team skills
- Realistic content volume

---

### Phase 3: Similar Games Analysis

**Find and analyze comparable games:**

1. **Identify Similar Games** (3-5 examples)
   - Same genre/mechanics
   - Similar scope
   - Both indie and AAA examples
   - Successful and failed projects

2. **Extract Lessons**
   - Development timeline
   - Team size
   - What worked well
   - What they cut/simplified
   - Common player feedback

3. **Scope Comparison**
   - How does user's concept compare?
   - What did similar games ship with?
   - What features came later?

---

## Validation Principles

### Be Honest, Not Discouraging
- ✅ Point out risks clearly
- ✅ Suggest concrete solutions
- ✅ Acknowledge what's good
- ❌ Don't crush dreams without alternatives
- ❌ Don't rubber-stamp bad ideas

### Be Specific, Not Vague
- ✅ "Combat system needs state machine, collision detection, hit feedback - estimate 2 weeks"
- ❌ "Combat will be hard"

### Be Realistic, Not Pessimistic
- ✅ Use industry data and similar games
- ✅ Account for learning curves
- ✅ Include buffer for unknowns
- ❌ Don't assume everything goes perfectly
- ❌ Don't assume worst-case for everything

### Be Constructive, Not Critical
- ✅ "Cut feature X, focus on Y" with reasoning
- ✅ "Simplify Z to reduce scope without losing core"
- ❌ "This is too ambitious" without suggestions

---

## Research Strategies

### Finding Similar Games

**Search patterns:**
- "[Genre] + [key mechanic] + indie game"
- "[Core loop description] + game"
- "Games like [inspiration] but smaller scope"

**Sources:**
- Itch.io (indie games with dev blogs)
- Game jams (Ludum Dare, GMTK)
- Postmortems (Gamasutra, dev blogs)
- "Making of" videos (GDC, YouTube)

### Extracting Development Data

**Look for:**
- Dev time (search "development time", "took X months")
- Team size (credits, about pages)
- Tech stack (Unity/Unreal/Godot tags)
- Scope changes (postmortems mention cuts)
- Player counts (Steam stats)

**Red flags in research:**
- No postmortem data available → estimate conservatively
- Only AAA examples → scale down significantly
- Very old games → tech has changed

---

## Common Concept Patterns

### Pattern: "Like X but Y"

**Example:** "Like Vampire Survivors but with crafting"

**Validation approach:**
1. Research X (Vampire Survivors)
   - What made it successful?
   - How long to develop?
   - What's the minimum feature set?
2. Evaluate Y (crafting addition)
   - How complex is crafting system?
   - Does it complement or compete with core loop?
   - What's the integration cost?
3. Assess combined scope
   - Is it additive (2x effort) or synergistic?

**Common pitfall:** Underestimating integration complexity

---

### Pattern: "Multiple Genres Combined"

**Example:** "Puzzle-platformer with tower defense elements"

**Validation approach:**
1. Identify each genre's core loop
2. Map where loops intersect
3. Assess if loops compete or complement
4. Estimate development for each separately, then add 50% for integration

**Common pitfall:** Each genre needs full implementation, can't cut corners

---

### Pattern: "Procedural Everything"

**Example:** "Roguelike with procedural levels, enemies, weapons, and story"

**Validation approach:**
1. Prioritize what MUST be procedural
2. What can be handcrafted?
3. Prototype generator early (high risk)
4. Assess content creation vs generator development time

**Common pitfall:** Generator takes longer than making content manually

---

### Pattern: "Massive Content Scope"

**Example:** "RPG with 50 quests, 20 enemy types, 100 items"

**Validation approach:**
1. Calculate production time per asset
2. Multiply by quantity
3. Compare to timeline
4. Suggest MVP content volume (usually 20-30% of vision)

**Common pitfall:** Underestimating iteration time (balance, bugs, polish)

---

## Example Validation: "Mech Survivors"

**User Request:** "Validate this concept: A Vampire Survivors-like but with mechs that you customize between runs. 3D graphics, Godot, solo dev, 3 months."

**Validation Output:**

---

# Game Concept Validation Report

**Concept:** Mech Survivors (Vampire Survivors-like with mech customization)
**Submitted by:** User
**Date:** 2025-12-21
**Validation Status:** 🟡 Feasible with Adjustments

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall Assessment:** Achievable concept with strong core but needs scope refinement. 3D + customization significantly increases complexity compared to Vampire Survivors' 2D simplicity. Recommend starting with 2D or simplifying customization.

**Feasibility Rating:** 6/10 (as stated) → 8/10 (with adjustments)

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Proven core loop (Vampire Survivors formula)
- ✅ Clear differentiation (mechs + customization)
- ✅ Godot is excellent for this genre

**Key Risks:**
- 🚨 3D art + animation for solo dev in 3 months
- ⚠️ Customization system complexity
- ⚠️ Balance complexity with customizable builds

**Recommended Path:**
Start with **2D top-down** sprites (faster art pipeline) and **simplified customization** (3-4 weapon slots, 10-15 parts total). Build 3D version post-launch if successful.
